# Ideas to improve upon

* Use a card-based system to allow backwards-compatibility with current card system; but also allow direct linking to bank account for those who don't want to worry about loading money onto cards.
* Provide some sort of take-ten-trips-get-one-free incentive for using app and linking bank account
* Make payment as seamless as possible: one tap or even RFID location-based proximity payment
* Very intuitive UI for sort-use users like tourists who don't have time/patience to learn a complicated, Uberesque UI
* Show balance on home screen so it's easy to see how much loaded
