# General Assembly 2-day UX Design Bootcamp 

Project: WMATA pay / card-replacement app.

## Competitive Analysis

### Starbucks App Interface

Giftcard account management & payment app.

#### Pros

  * Auto-reload that triggers on set low balance
  * Rewards and incentives presented with delightful visuals
  * Multiple cards
  * Works anywhere
  * Broad focus
  * Must physically scan phone to pay

#### Cons

  * No credit to overdraft your account
  * Must load money onto 'cards'
  * Not easy to see total balance
  * No low balance notification

### EZ-Pass Device / Web Interface

Transit / auto toll automated payment device & web interface.

#### Pros

  * Credit to overdraft your account
  * Works multiple locations
  * Seamless payment

#### Cons

  * No good way of communicating problems
  * No rewards / incentives
  * Doesn't work beyond east coast
  * Must load money onto 'cards'

### Uber

#### Pros

  * Seamless payment; user does nothing
  * Credit to overdraft your account
  * Rating and reporting system for drivers and users

#### Cons

  * Main screen options overwhelming for new user; limited onboarding

### Ideas to improve upon

* Use a card-based system to allow backwards-compatibility with current card system; but also allow direct linking to bank account for those who don't want to worry about loading money onto cards.
* Provide some sort of take-ten-trips-get-one-free incentive for using app and linking bank account
* Make payment as seamless as possible: one tap or even RFID location-based proximity payment
* Very intuitive UI for sort-use users like tourists who don't have time/patience to learn a complicated, Uberesque UI
* Show balance on home screen so it's easy to see how much loaded

## Heuristic Evaluation

### Starbucks

#### User Control & Freedom

* Difficult to recover from accidental touch commands that bring user to a new screen.
* No post-hoc error correction.

#### Error Prevention

* Popup with password lock before you can execute a large-dollar transaction.

#### Visibility of Systems / Status

![balance](http://i.imgur.com/8qtNFSo.jpg)

* Shows card(s) balance on main screen on Android version, but not iOS.
* On pay screen, pay button is activated and other top nav options grey out

#### Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design

* Flat ghost elements, monochrome hues, and uppercase geometric text guide users directly to simple set of actions.
